    "## Dusting off an Old Blog\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometime ago, about ten years, on my first trip to India I had kept a blog over the first several months. After that, I suspect I got far too busy to keep it up. I had forgotten about it until I started writing agaain a few weeks ago. And I thought it might be fun to try and find it. As it turned out, all I had of it was a sql dump from the wordpress database I had back then. Extracting and formatting it manually would be a pain, so I thought I'd use this as an opportunity to apply some of the recent learning using sql, some basic formatting functions, markdown, etc to do the work for me. Notes on that below. This took the better part of a Sunday afternoon. A lot of that actually just getting mySQL to work, but still I was reminded that knowing how to do something and having the fluency that comes from having mastered it are two totally different things.
